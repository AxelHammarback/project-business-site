## About
The purpose of the assignment was to create a business site, with a focus on **HTML forms**, how to implement a **hero video**, and the basics of **Javascript** (which is used for the accordion). 

I created a fake startup called Hibr™, which is a new and revolutionary way for you to escape the monotony of every day life (2020 – what a year, am I right?), which essentially sells **sleep**. 

## The problem

I started out with [designing the site in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/rzd0AX06vXUYVP4DWIP474/project-business-site?node-id=0%3A1), to have tangible target to work against. Then, I focused on the learnings needed for the form and accordion, which I managed to implement a lot thanks not only to Maks' lecture, but to my team member Anna Hasselström who shared a guide on how to work with the accortion, and helped out with a good way to implement the hero video. 

## To do
As always, there are a lot of things I'd like to do if I had more time. Here are a few:

* Make it responsive. It isn't. I believe the effort to make it so wouldn't be great, but since it was covered in last week's project, I had to stop somewhere.
* Continuously update the slider. I didn't manage to make it work (it currently updates on mouse button release, rather than on change).
* Animating the accordion. I settled for the display: none method, since I think it looks good enough.
* Write better CSS code. A lot of it is a huge mess right now, and I would love to learn how to think in order to structure it better from the start. 

But, yeah – all in all, it's still just the second week. Happy and proud of what I've learned so far.
