          <div class="accordion-item-body">
            <p class="accordion-item-body-content">Very good question, thank you for that. The idea for Hibr™ was spawned when our Tech Lord and Unicorn Ninja Founder Jort W. Dildeaux™ was at his weekly tantric Shambala Mountain Silent Retreat session, and got the epiphany that he wanted to generously give people with enough means an escape from the world.</p> <p>He wants to Hibr™ the world.</p>

          <div class="accordion-item-body">
            <p class="accordion-item-body-content">There are numerous ways we could answer that. But, let me ask <span class="emphasise">you</span> a question. What <span class="emphasise">is</span> safe, really?</p> <p>As the great, late, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr once said; "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all."</p> <p>Just, wow. Jaw? Dropped.</p>

            <p> What does it cost?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item-body">
            <p class="accordion-item-body-content">The price depends on a number of factors, such as how long you want to be Hibr'd™, your age, social class, genetic structure, and marital status; to mention a few of them.</p> <p>But we don't like to talk about boring stuff like cost (snooze), and price (yawn)—that's suit stuff!</p><p>What it all boils down to is—can you really put a price on security? On comfort? Peace of mind for you and your loved ones? If you ask Hibr™—the answer is no.</p>

            <p> How does Hibr work? This sounds too good to be true.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item-body">
            <p class="accordion-item-body-content">Hibr™ leverages agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level overviews. Iterative approaches to corporate strategy foster collaborative thinking to further the overall value proposition. Organically grow the holistic world view of disruptive innovation via workplace diversity and empowerment.</p>

              <p>Furthermore, Hibr™ brings to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.</p>

              <p>We also capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.</p>

              <p>But the key lies in podcasting operational change management inside of workflows to establish a framework. Taking seamless key performance indicators offline to maximise the long tail. Keeping your eye on the ball while performing a deep dive on the start-up mentality to derive convergence on cross-platform integration.

              <p>Last, but not least, Hibr™ collaboratively administrate empowered markets via plug-and-play networks. Dynamically procrastinate B2C users after installed base benefits. Dramatically visualize customer directed convergence without revolutionary ROI.</p>
